Hello! I'm Noam and I am making cool i-ready hacks! I have not gotten any yet, but when I do, i'll put them on here. Wait about a week or so more and I will have finished my i-ready hacks. I love making hacks for you guys so I will soon make more for other games. For now, I want to show you something I think is cool. Copy this link and you will be able to edit things on a site you cannot type on. Super cool! Copy this link, go to bookmarks, click add bookmark, then in the bottom corner, click more, and then finally, type in what you want to call it in the "name" box then take out the old URL and paste the one you copied. Good luck!

javascript:document.body.contentEditable = 'true'; document.designMode='on'; void 0

Enjoy! (also sometimes these hacks don't work but they usually start working again from 1-7 days)

P.S. in order for these hacks to work, type in javascript: before you paste the code, EXCEPT FOR THE EDIT HACK!!!
